<!-- To summarize, prototype is the mechanism through which objects inherit properties and methods in JavaScript, while inheritance is the concept of creating a hierarchy of objects where one object can inherit from another. In JavaScript, inheritance is typically achieved by setting up the prototype chain using the prototype object of constructor functions or the Object.create() method. -->
